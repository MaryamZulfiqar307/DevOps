# Software Development Life Cycle
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that is used to develop software applications. It consists of several phases that are designed to ensure that software is developed and delivered in a structured and controlled manner. 

## Phases of SDLC

1. **Planning:** 
Defining the project scope, identifying the requirements, and creating a project plan.

2.  **Analysis:** 
Gathering and documenting the requirements(functional and non-functional) for the software application. They are documented as **SRS(Software Requirement Specification)**.

3.	**Design:** 
Software architecture is designed i.e., the overall structure of the application, user interface, and the database schema. It’s documented as **DDS(design document Specification)** and is shared with the stake holder and analyst for review.

4.	**Development/ Implementation/ Coding:** 
Implementing the design and coding the software.

5.	**Testing:** 
Deploying the software in a testing environment and fix bugs and defects. This helps check the reliability, security, and scalability of the software.

6.	**Deployment:** 
Installing the software, configuring it, and ensuring that it is running smoothly and efficiently.

7.	**Maintenance:** 
Fixing bugs and defects, updating the software to meet changing requirements, and ensuring that it remains secure and reliable.

## SDLC Models

## Waterfall Model

-	Sequential approach. 
-	One phase must be completed before moving to the next. 
-	Requirements are gathered in the beginning. (rigid) 
-	Fixed scope. 
-	No flexibility or adaptability. 
-	Works on a fixed timeline. 
-	Testing is done at the end of the project.
-	No customer involvement. (only in the start and end)

## Spiral, Iterative and RAD Models 

- Spiral uses a risk driven approach. 
-	Each iteration includes an evaluation and risk analysis. 
-	It’s used by large teams and projects having complex requirement.

-	Iterative model breaks project into sprints.
-	Each sprint includes planning, development and testing phase. 
-	It is used for projects requiring continuous improvement. 

-	RAD allowed rapid prototyping and iterative development.

These models were introduced to cover the shortcomings of the waterfall model but they did not bring any revolutionary change.

## Agile Model

-	It uses a iterative incremental approach.
-	The project is broken down into small iteration. (sprints) 
-	Follows the scrum framework. 
-	Requirements are gathered incrementally and they keep changing. 
-	Flexible and adaptable.
-	Project evolves overtime; it does not work on a fixed time frame. 
-	Each sprint includes planning, development and testing phase.
-	Ensures team collaboration and customer involvement.
