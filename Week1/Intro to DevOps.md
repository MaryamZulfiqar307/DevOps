# Introduction to DevOps
### History of DevOps (Story time)
The history of DevOps can be traced back to the early 2000s, when Agile development methodologies were gaining popularity. While Agile helped to break down silos between developers and testers, it did not address the operational side of software development, leading to a divide between development and operations teams.

The term "DevOps" was first coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, a software developer who was frustrated by the lack of communication and collaboration between development and operations teams. Debois organized the first "DevOpsDays" conference in Belgium, which brought together developers, operations professionals, and other stakeholders to discuss the challenges of software development and operations.

In the years that followed, DevOps gained popularity as more organizations recognized the benefits of breaking down the silos between development and operations teams. DevOps practices and tools continued to evolve throughout the 2010s, with a growing focus on automation and continuous delivery. 

Today, DevOps has become a standard approach to software development and operations, with a wide range of tools and practices available to help teams work more collaboratively and efficiently. 

### DevOps
