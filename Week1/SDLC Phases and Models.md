# Software Development Life Cycle
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that is used to develop software applications. It consists of several phases that are designed to ensure that software is developed and delivered in a structured and controlled manner. 

##Phases of SDLC
1.	**Planning:** 
Defining the project scope, identifying the requirements, and creating a project plan.

2.	Analysis: 
Gathering and documenting the requirements(functional and non-functional) for the software application. They are documented as SRS(Software Requirement Specification).

3.	Design: 
Software architecture is designed i.e., the overall structure of the application, user interface, and the database schema. Itâ€™s documented as DDS(design document Specification) and is shared with the stake holder and analyst for review.

4.	Development/ Implementation/ Coding: 
Implementing the design and coding the software.

5.	Testing: 
Deploying the software in a testing environment and fix bugs and defects. This helps check the reliability, security, and scalability of the software.

6.	Deployment: 
Installing the software, configuring it, and ensuring that it is running smoothly and efficiently.

7.	Maintenance: 
Fixing bugs and defects, updating the software to meet changing requirements, and ensuring that it remains secure and reliable.
