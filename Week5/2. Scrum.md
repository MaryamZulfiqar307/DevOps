# Scrum

- A framework for agile project management 
- Designed to help teams develop, deliver and sustain complex products
- Collaborative, iterative, and incremental approach to work
- Based on empirical process control theory, which emphasizes transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

# Scrum roles

## Scrum Master
- Facilitates the Scrum events
- Helps the team to follow the Scrum framework and practices
- Removes impediments that block the team's progress
- Helps the team to continuously improve by identifying areas of improvement and suggesting solutions
- Helps the team to estimate and forecast the work to be done
- Acts as a coach, mentor, and servant leader to the team

## Product Owner
- Defines the product vision and roadmap
- Creates and maintains the product backlog
- Prioritizes items in the backlog based on business value and customer feedback
- Ensures that the team understands the items in the backlog
- Accepts or rejects the work completed by the team based on the Definition of Done
- Ensures that the product meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations
 
## Scrum Team
- Self-organizes to complete the work defined in the sprint backlog
- Estimates the effort required to complete the items in the sprint backlog
- Collaborates with the Product Owner to clarify the requirements and refine the backlog
- Creates a plan for the sprint and delivers a potentially releasable product increment by the end of the sprint
- Participates in the Scrum events and provides regular updates on the progress and any impediments
- Identifies areas of improvement and works to continuously improve their work


# Sprint
- A time-boxed iteration of work that lasts for a specific duration (~2 weeks)
- It is the core unit of development in Scrum 
- Breaks down a larger project into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Scrum team works to complete a set of prioritized user stories from the product backlog. 
- Sprint Goal: Produce a potentially releasable increment of the product.
- Each sprint has its own scrum events

## Scrum Events

### Sprint Planning
- The Scrum Team meets to plan the upcoming Sprint.
- The Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the Product Backlog.
- The team agrees on a Sprint Goal and selects items from the Product Backlog that can be completed during the Sprint.
- The team creates a Sprint Backlog, which is a list of tasks to be completed during the sprint.

### Daily Scrum
- Each day of the sprint, the team holds a Daily Scrum meeting
- This is a short meeting, typically lasting no more than 15 minutes
- Each team member answers three questions:
   - What did I do yesterday?
   - What will I do today?
   - Are there any obstacles in my way?
   
### Sprint Review
- At the end of the sprint, the team holds a Sprint Review meeting
- During this meeting, the team presents the work they have completed to the Product Owner and stakeholders if any. 
- The goal of the Sprint Review is to gather feedback and determine if the work completed during the sprint meets the "Definition of Done."

### Sprint Retrospective
- After the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team meets for a Sprint Retrospective
- The team reflects on the previous Sprint and identifies what worked well and what could be improved.
- The Scrum Team creates a plan for implementing those improvements during the next Sprint.

## Sprint milestones
- A sprint milestone refers to the end of a sprint, typically marked by the completion of a set of user stories or tasks
- It indicates that the team has achieved a specific goal that was set at the beginning of the sprint
- They are important because they allow the team to assess their progress and adjust their plans for future sprints.


# Scrum Artifacts

## Product Backlog
- a prioritized list of user stories, features, and other requirements for a product. 
- Owned by the Product Owner and constantly refined and updated throughout the project.
- Used by the scrum team to plan and execute sprints

### How to build a product backlog
1. **Gathering Requirements:** The first step in building a product backlog is to gather requirements from various stakeholders such as customers, end-users, business analysts, and product owners. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other techniques.

2. **Writing User Stories:** Once the requirements are gathered, they need to be translated into user stories that describe the behavior and functionality of the product. 

3. **Prioritizing:** The next step is to prioritize the user stories based on their value to the customers and the business.

4. **Estimating:** After the user stories are prioritized, they need to be estimated in terms of the effort required to develop them. ~story points

5. **Backlog refinement:** It is the process of continuously improving the product backlog by adding, removing, or modifying user stories based on new information or feedback from stakeholders or team. This is an ongoing process that takes place throughout the project.

## Sprint Backlog
- A list of user stories, features, and other requirements selected by the scrum team for a sprint.
- Based on the priorities set in the Product Backlog and the team's capacity for work.
- Used to plan and track progress during the sprint

## Increment
- The sum of all the completed product backlog items at the end of each sprint
- An increment must be in a useable condition, meeting the team's definition of "Done"
- Builds on previous increments and provides value to the stakeholders.

### User Stories
   - A short, simple descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the user
   - User stories are typically written in a specific format that includes a user, an action, and a benefit.
   - Example: As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history, so that I can keep track of my purchases and returns.

#### INVEST characteristics of a User Story
- Independent: A good user story should be self-contained and not depend on other stories or tasks. 
- Negotiable: User stories should be open to negotiation and discussion.
- Valuable: Each user story should deliver value to the customer or end user. This value can be in the form of a new feature, improved functionality, or better usability.
- Estimable: Stories should be able to be estimated in terms of complexity, effort, and time. This helps the team to plan and prioritize work.
- Small: Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. 
- Testable: User stories should be testable, so that the team can verify that the story has been completed successfully.


### Story points
- A measure used by Agile teams to estimate the level of effort required to complete a user story 
- All the scrum roles are responsible for assigning story points to user stories
- Measured using a fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21 etc.)

### Epic
- An epic is a large, high-level user story that describes a broad feature
- Epics can be created by product owners, stakeholders, or other members of the team to capture big-picture ideas and goals.
- An epic can be broken down into smaller user stories
- Epics typically span multiple sprints and may take several months or even longer to complete.
- Example:
Epic: "Customer Checkout." This epic includes a broad set of features related to the checkout process, such as adding items to the cart, entering shipping and billing information, and processing payments. The team can then break down this epic into smaller, more manageable user stories, such as "As a customer, I want to add items to my cart," "As a customer, I want to enter my shipping information," and "As a customer, I want to process my payment." 

### Burndown Chart
- Graphical representation used in Scrum to track progress during a sprint.
- Helps the scrum team to stay on track and identify issues or obstacles that may prevent them from completing the sprint on time.
- The chart has two axes: one for time and one for work remaining.
- The time axis is divided into increments of days or weeks
- The work remaining axis is measured in story points
- The remaining work is updated and plotted on the chart as the sprint progresses.
- If progress is good, the line on the chart will slope downwards towards zero, indicating that the work is being completed on time.

# Measuring Sprint Success
1. Sprint Goal Achievement
2. Velocity: Velocity is a metric that indicates the amount of work completed by the team in a sprint. It is calculated by adding up the story points or tasks completed in a sprint. A consistent increase in velocity over time indicates that the team is becoming more efficient, and the sprint can be considered a success.
