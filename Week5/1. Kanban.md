# Kanban
- A visual management tool used in project management and software development
- Developed by Toyota in the 1940s as part of their lean manufacturing system
- Japanese term meaning "visual signal" or "card"
- A typical kanban system consists of a **board** that represent different stages of a workflow and **cards/ sticky notes** to represent individual tasks or items.
- Clear and transparent view of the work that needs to be done
- Helps teams manage their workflow more effectively
- Used by teams of any size, from small startups to large enterprises.

Kanban can be used in conjunction with other agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to provide a more holistic approach to project management and software development.





## Kanban Board
- The most commonly used form of kanban is the kanban board (can be physical or digital)
- Commonly used in agile software development and other lean manufacturing environments
- It consists of three columns: "To Do," "Doing," and "Done"
- Cards or sticky notes are used to represent individual tasks or work items.
- Cards are moved from left to right across the board as work progresses.
- Team members can quickly see the status of each task and identify bottlenecks or issues in the workflow.

### Benefits
- Effective collaboration
