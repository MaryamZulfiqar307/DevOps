# Version Control System VCS

## Types of VCS
- Centralized: A central repository that serves as the authoritative source for all changes. Developers check out files from the central repository, make changes, and then check them back in. 
 Example: Subversion (SVN)

- Distributed: It creates a local repository on each developer's machine, allowing developers to work offline and synchronize changes with each other as needed.
 Example: Git, Mercurial
