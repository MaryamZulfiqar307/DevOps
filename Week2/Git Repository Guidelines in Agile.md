# Version Control System VCS
- A version control system (VCS) is a software tool used to manage changes to code.
- It allows developers to track and manage changes to files, collaborate and maintain a record of revisions and updates.

## Types of VCS
- **Centralized:** A central repository that serves as the authoritative source for all changes. Developers check out files from the central repository, make changes, and then check them back in. 
 Example: Subversion (SVN)

- **Distributed:** It creates a local repository on each developer's machine, allowing developers to work offline and synchronize changes with each other as needed.
 Example: Git, Mercurial
 

# Git
Git is a popular version control system used in Agile development.

# Git Repository Guidelines

1. **Branching Strategy:** Teams should create a new branch for each feature or user story, and merge it into the main branch once complete and tested.

2. **Committing Code:**
   Commit small changes focused on a single feature or change, and commit frequently to keep a history of changes.

3. **Code Review:** 
   Review code before merging it into the main branch to ensure it meets coding standards and doesn't introduce bugs.

4. **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** 
   Teams should automate testing and deployment processes to ensure that changes are tested and deployed quickly. 

5. **Versioning:** 
   Teams should use versioning to keep track of changes and releases. This includes creating tags for each release and ensuring that version numbers are consistent across all components of the system.

By following these guidelines, teams can ensure that their Git repository is well-maintained and supports the Agile development process.
