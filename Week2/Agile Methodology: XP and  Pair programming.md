# Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a set of values/ an approach to software development which focuses on teamwork, customer collaboration and response to change(testing).

- It replaced the waterfall model for the better.
- 97% of organizations are now practicing agile development methodologies.
- It enables early delivery, continual development, and flexibility regarding response to changes.
- Cross functional teams can develop and iterate, producing minimum viable products **MVPs**(will be discussed later on) easier.
- Continuous feedback
- Breaking down project into smaller chunks.
- Added business value.

# Agile Manifesto
The guiding principle for Agile software development. It says, we have come to value: 
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

Meaning that agile methodology values change and collaboration as compared to preplanned, documented traditional models

# The 12 Principles of Agile Methodology
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of useful software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Frequently Delivered Software (weeks rather than months)
4. Work together
5. Trust and Support
6. Face to Face conversation
7. Working Software
8. Sustainable development
9. Continuous Attention
10. Simplicity 
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Reflect & Adjust

# Agile Terminologies

- **Product backlog:** List of requirements provided by the customer in the form of Epic, Features, Stories.
- **Epic:** Large level requirements. ~Completion Time: Months
- **Feature:** Divisions of Epic, precisely defines the needs of the customer. ~Time: Weeks
- **Story:** Detailed definition of each feature. ~Time: Days
- **Tasks:** Solution of each story. ~Time: Hours

# Agile Frameworks
Agile provides us with a framework where continuous improvements happen in SDLC stages. Commonly used framworks are:

- Scrum
- Lean
- Kanban Software Development
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Feature Driven Development (FDD)
- Crystal

## Agile follows the Plan-Design-Build-Test-Review Approach
