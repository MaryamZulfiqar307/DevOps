  # Batch
  
- A set of work items grouped together for processing/ delivery.
- Batching is a common practice in Agile to improve efficiency and streamline workflows.
- Break down larger work items into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Batches are made of user stories/features etc.
- Smaller batches are more preferable.


## Example
Your team has to make the home page for a clothing website, which involves tasks such as designing the user interface, implementing backend functionality, and testing the feature thoroughly. Instead of trying to make the entire homepage at once, the team can break it down into smaller batches,
  
   Batch 1: Create a basic UI wireframe
   
   Batch 2: Implement basic functionality on the backend 
  
   Batch 3: Develop the UI components and styles 
  
   Batch 4: Add more advanced functionality to the backend, such as data persistence and error handling
  
   Batch 5: Integrate the backend and frontend components and test the feature end-to-end.

## Benefits of working in Batches in Agile

- Increased efficiency
- Faster feedback from stakeholders and faster iteration
- Risk mitigation/ Reduced risk of failure due to early-on detection of errors
- Flexibility and adaptability
- Delivering value to customer
