Now that we've discussed what Agile is, lets discover one of many Agile frameworks i.e., Extreme programming. 

# Extreme Programming (XP)
- Developed by Kent Beck
 - It is a lightweight process that focuses on customer satisfaction and team collaboration.
 - It follows a set of values (Agile Manifesto)


# XP Core Values
1. Communication
2. Simplicity
3. Feedback
4. Respect
5. Courage

![9 Practices of XP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128154979/226687902-8d0b5d58-9397-439c-b8e1-07300a2b89d3.jpg)

1.  **Planning Game:** This involves both the development team and the customer. The customer prioritizes the requirements, and the team estimates the effort required to implement them. This approach enables the team to focus on delivering the highest value features first.

2.  **Small Releases:** XP emphasizes the delivery of small, working increments of software. This practice allows the customer to see progress and provide feedback early in the development process.
 
3. **Metaphor:** This means a simple layman explanation of how the code works, i.e., the ability to explain the system to the new people without flooding them with technical terms.

4. **Simple Design:** Encouraging the team to keep the system design as simple as possible. The goal is to minimize complexity and ensure that the system is easy to understand, maintain, and modify.

5. **Test-driven:** First write the test code and then write the program. 

6. **Refactoring:** Its primary focus is to remove the duplication of various processes.

7. **Pair Programming:** Two developers working together on the same code at the same time. The driver writes the code and the obsever identifies/ reviews mistakes simultaneously.

8. **Collective Ownership:** The entire team takes ownership of the code. It promotes collaboration and teamwork, as every team member can work on any part of the code.

9. **Continuous Integration:** Integrating the code into the main codebase frequently. The primary goal of CI is to identify issues and conflicts in the codebase as early as possible, allowing developers to resolve them quickly.
 
10. **40-Hour Week:** All team members must complete 40 Hours/week. This practice is used to ensure that the team members have a good work-life balance. 
 
11. **On-Site Customer:** This practice involves having a customer representative on the development team who provides regular feedback. 

12. **Coding Standards:** Coding standards are guidelines that the team follows when writing code. These guidelines ensure that the code is consistent and maintainable, regardless of who wrote it.
