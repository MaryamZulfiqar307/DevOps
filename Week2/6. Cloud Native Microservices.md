# Monolithic vs Microservice Architecture

## Monlithic (tightly coupled)
- Built as a single unit and deployed as a single package.
- All components of the application share the same codebase and technology stack.
- Deployment cycles are slower because of the need to test/ release the entire application at once.

## Microservices (loosely coupled)
- A software architecture that involves breaking down a large application into small, independent services.
- Each service is independently developed, tested, and deployed.
- Each service can have its own technology stack and codebase.
- Teams can use different languages/ tools for different services.
- Changes/ updates can be made to individual services without affecting the rest of the application, making it easier to test and deploy new features.

# Cloud Native Architecture

1. Immutable infrastructure:
   * Embraces the Cattle service model
   * Provisions virtual machines or containers
   * Servers are destroyed and replaced with new ones via automation
   * Continues to run as infrastructure scales in or out

2. Microservices:
   * Small, independent software components
   * Loosely coupled and communicate with each other
   * Changes made by working on individual microservices
   * Application continues to function even if one microservice fails

3. API:

   * Method for two or more software programs to exchange information
   * Brings loosely coupled microservices together

4. Service mesh:

   * Manages communication between multiple microservices
   * Introduces additional functions without writing new code in the application
   * Software layer in the cloud infrastructure

   _API and Service mesh are solely used for communication between microservices_
   
   
5. Containers:

   * Smallest compute unit in a cloud-native application
   * Pack microservice code and other required files
   * Runs independently of underlying OS and hardware
   * Deployable on premises, cloud infrastructure, or hybrid clouds
   * Tool: Docker, Kubernetes

### Benefits of containers:


   * Use fewer computing resources than conventional deployment
   * Almost instant deployment
   * Efficiently scale cloud computing resources

# Cloud Native Development Practices

1. Continuous integration:
   * Frequent integration of changes into shared code base
   * Automated code quality assessments
   * Faster issue identification and troubleshooting

2. Continuous delivery:
   * Supports cloud-native development
   * Ensures microservices are always ready to be deployed to the cloud
   * Reduces risk with software automation tools

3. DevOps:
   * Improves collaboration between development and operations teams
   * Speeds up software development lifecycle
   * Uses DevOps tools for cloud-native development automation

4. Serverless:
   * Cloud provider fully manages underlying server infrastructure
   * Infrastructure automatically scales and configures for application requirements
   * Developers only pay for resources used, and they're removed when the app stops running
