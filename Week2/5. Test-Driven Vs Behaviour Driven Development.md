# Test Driven Development

- Describing behaviour of code before implementing it
- Its a core agile practice
- Stands for the Agile Manifesto: _Working software over comprehensive documentation_
- Focus: "Confirming behaviour", not "testing code"
- Tools: JUnit, NUnit, TestNG

# Red Green Refactor

# Benefits of TDD

- Reduction in bugs
- Clear and simple code
- Avoids duplication of code
- Refactoring improves code 
- Early bug diagnosis

# Disadvantages of TDD

- High maintenance cost
- Must change if requirement changes

# Testing Strategies

## Functional testing
Testing actual code

1. **Unit testing:** Smallest piece of code that can be isolated
2. **Integration/ I&T:** Individual software modules tested together as a combined entity
3. **End to End/E2E:** Test the application from start to finish, ensuring it meets user requirements
4. **Acceptance Test:** Test to verify that the application solves the problem it was made to solve
6. **System Test:** Test performed on complete system

## Non-functional testing
Testing environment/ specs of the application ex: performance, usability etc.

1. **Stress testing:** How the system performs incase of failure
2. **Endurance Testing:**Test the systems power to handle overload 
   
   _There are many more non-functional/ functional testing methods you can look in to from the web_
   
# Behavior Driven Development

- A methodology to cover gap b/w Technical & business team.
- Technical team handles developers and testing
- Business team understands user scenario and user application perspective
- Tools: Cucumber, Specflow, Mspec

# Phases of BDD

- The _Documented example_ is called the _Living document_ as its the teams shared understanding of the application behaviour
- The discovery phase works based on the user story.
### User Story
   A good User Story should describe the Who (actor), What (feature) and Why (benefit).

As an (actor),
I want a (feature),
So that (benefit)

#### Example:
As a  bank customer,
I want to see balance on my account,
So that I can withdraw accordingly

### BDD Scenario
**Scenario:** Get something
  
  _Given_ I have something
  
  _When_ I do something
  
  _Then_ I get something else

**Scenario:** Show balance on the accounts page after logging in
  
  _Given_ I have just logged on to the mobile banking app
  
  _When_ I load the accounts page
  
  _Then_ I can see account balance for each of my accounts

# TDD vs BDD

TDD | BDD
--- | --- 
Scope: Development practice | Scope: Team methodology
Design and Specification at code level | Improve collaboration and communication 
Tests written by developers | Automated specs created by user/ tester
Focus: Implementation of different functions | Focus: App behavior from end user perspective
Testing based on test cases | Testing based on scenarios

# Importance of TDD in DevOps

- TDD supports automation
- Continuous delivery depends on testing
- High quality software
- Reliable/ Scalable/ Maintainable
- Ensures the software meets stakeholder needs
