# TDD vs BDD
Both employ test-first approaches, but are not about testing.
BDD is about improving collaboration and communication between developers, testers, and business professionals. To ensure software meets both business objectives and customer requirements.
TDD is about design and specifications at the code level.
BDD works at the application and requirements level. TDD focuses on the level of the code that implements those requirements.
TDD is, or can be used as the “Make tests pass” phase of BDD.
In TDD you can, but don’t need to, use techniques from BDD down to the smallest level of abstraction.
BDD doesn’t have a refactor phase like TDD.
