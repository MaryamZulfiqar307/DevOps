# Designing for Failure

## Features for Designing for Failure in DevOps:
- **Fail fast:**
   Instead of trying to prevent failures, design systems that can quickly detect and respond to issues when they do occur.
- Automate recovery
- Monitor systems
- Test for failure
- Build in security

# Retry Pattern
Automatically retrying an operation that has failed, with the aim of eventually succeeding.

- Execute the operation.
- If the operation succeeds, return the result.
- If the operation fails due to a known and transient error, such as a network error, pause for a short time, and then retry the operation.
- If the operation fails due to an unknown error or a persistent error, such as a misconfiguration, do not retry the operation, but instead return an error to the caller.

# Circuit Breaker Pattern 

When a certain threshold of failures is reached, circuit trips and prevents further requests from being sent to the operation under observation. 
- Monitor the status of an operation.
- If the operation or service is healthy and responsive, allow requests to be sent.
- If the operation or service starts to fail, record the failures and check if they reach a threshold.
- If the threshold is reached, trip the circuit and stop sending requests to the operation.
- After a certain amount of time, attempt to reset the circuit and allow requests to be sent again.

# Bulkhead Pattern
Limiting the impact of failures in one part of the application on the others. 

   * Isolation: The components of an application are isolated from each other, so that a failure in one component does not bring down the entire application.
   * Redundancy: Multiple instances of each component are created to provide redundancy, so that if one instance fails, another can take over its workload.
   * Resource allocation: Resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth are allocated to each component to ensure that one component cannot monopolize the resources and starve the others.

# Monkey Testing
Randomly generating user input or events to test the system's stability and responsiveness under unpredictable and unusual conditions. 

### Example
The Netflix Simian Army

- A collection of open-source tools that Netflix uses to introduce various types of failures to test the resiliency of their cloud-based infrastructure. 
- The suite includes tools like Chaos Monkey, Latency Monkey, and Conformity Monkey, among others. 
- Each tool is designed to simulate specific failure scenarios and help Netflix engineers identify and address potential issues before they cause significant problems.
