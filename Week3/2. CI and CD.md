# Continuous Integration
- CI/CD are not one word
- CI is the process of continuously building, testing, merging code to the master branch
- Result: Deployable code

### Traditional Dev Practices

- Periodical merging of branches
- Takes days to merge code
- Branching was expensive before git
- Hard to merge brances; Code drifts away from the Master branch

### CI Practices

- Integrate daily
- Feature branches, when feature is completed merge it in Master
- Check-in verified by an automated build
- After merging, feature is deleted and a new feature is created

### Batches
- Work in small batches
- Commit regularly
- Use pull requests

### CI Automation

- Build and test every pull rquest
- Use a CI tool (jenkins) to monitor the Version Coontrol
- Merge in Master only when test passes

### Benefits of CI
- Faster reaction time
- Better code quality 
- Code integration risk reduced
- Master branch is always deployable

# Continuous Delivery
Martin Fowler said, 

   "Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time."

### Release to production at any time?
This means that the master branch is always deployable. How's that possible? By building and testing every change made AKA "Continuous Integration"

   This means that CD requires CI.

In other words, 

- CD is the process of ensuring that code can be deployed to production by **delivering change** to production like environment.
- _Production like environment_ is a mimic of the actual production environment
- We can not do CD in the actual production environment; that would be called "Continuous Deployment"

### DevOps Cycle
You rememer the DevOps cycle?(refer to week1)
   
   The first half (Plan, Code, Build, Test) is part of Continuous Integration
   
   The second half (Release, Deploy, Operate) is part of Continuous Delivery


# CI/CD Pipeline
Automated gates create a pipeline of checks: 
- Unit testing
- Code quality checks
- Integration and testing
- Security testing etc.

Tools provide a way to automate deployment
   
### Building a CI/CD pipeline
1. Code repository: stores the source code 
2. Build server: provided by the cloud
3. Integration server/ orchestration
4. Artifact repositor: stores binaries that have been tested
5. A tool for auto configuration and deployment: also provided by the cloud

### 5 Key Principles
1. Built in quality
2. Worling in small batches
3. Automate repetitive tasks, leave the problem solving to the developers
4. Continuous improvement
5. Shared responsibility (eg: fixing a broken branch is everyone's responsibility)


# CI/CD and Continuous Deployment
Deploying to the actual production environment

# Risk Management in DevOps
- Increase rate of change rather than avoiding change
- DEPLOY DEPLOY DEPLOY as much as possible. Use staging env, production like env, testing env, just DEPLOY
- Deploy early and often
- Deployment is automated

This makes sure it works well in the actual production environment
### Feature Flag
A technique that allows developers to turn a feature ON/OFF without redeploying.

- Deploy a feature, turn it ON; if the feature is not working turn it OFF.
- Purpose of flag: To decouple deployment from activation

### Zero Down Time Deployment
A technique that allows updates or changes to be made to a system without any interruption of service to users. The goal is to ensure that the system remains available and fully functional while the deployment process is taking place. This approach typically involves using redundant hardware, load balancers, or virtualization technology, to enable the new version of the software to be brought online while the old version is still running, and to redirect traffic to the new version once it is fully operational, without any disruption to users. Zero downtime deployment is essential for systems that need to be available 24/7 and that cannot tolerate any downtime.
