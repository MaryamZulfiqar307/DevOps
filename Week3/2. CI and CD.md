# Continuous Delivery
Martin Fowler said, 
   "Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time."

### Release to production at any time?

### 
- CD is the process of ensuring that code can be deployed to production by **delivering change** to production like environment.
- _Production like environment_ is a mimic of the actual production environment
- We can not do CD in the actual production environment; that would be called Continuous Deployment
