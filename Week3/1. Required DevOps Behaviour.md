# Traditional Ops
- Build the entire software all at once
- Clashing culture
- Dev: Wants change
- Ops: Wants stability

### How Development team views Operations team
- They manually implement changes
- Lack of testing/ backout plans

### How Oerations team views Development team
- They dont understand code
- They just cut/ paste work as in a word document

### No Win  Scenario
Let's say a company developed a website,
     
   If it works = Dev Team gets the credit
   
   If its down = Ops Team gets the blame

This leads to unhealthy organizational culture

# Required DevOps Behaviour

DevOps changes the traditional Ops entirely.

- Shared Ownership _instead of_ silos
- Risk management _instead of_ fear of change
- Repeatable build _instead of_ build once
- Automated self service _instead of_ manual work
- Feedback loops _instead of_ alarms and call backs

# Infrastructure as Code
It is the practice of describing infrastructure in textual format(code) for easy system configuration. 

### Configuration Management System
This code is given to an IaC tool like Terraform, Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. This tool then builds your infrastructure elements (server, network, storage etc.)

The system describes the code, creates the infrastructure and keeps it intact.

Also, system changes are never done manually. A version control is used for this purpose.

### Infrastrcuture Failure

- When servers are updated, they cause a major source of failure due to misconfiguration
- Servers are cattle not pets
- Replace them when they stop working
- Infrastructure is transient (Use & Replace)
- Infrastructure as code allows to create an identical Infrastructure
- Servers are built on demand via automation
