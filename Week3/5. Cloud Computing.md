# Cloud Computing vs On Premise

Cloud Computing   | On Premise
--- | --- 
**SCALABILITY**               | 
Pay only for how much you use |Pay more, high maintenance cost
Easily scale up/ down         |Can not scale down
**STORAGE**                |
Cloud service providers manage servers | Takes a lot of space and money
**SECURITY**|
Better secuirty | less secure
Security protcols are managed by CSP|

# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, including software, network infrastructure, and data storage, over the internet. Instead of investing in physical infrastructure and maintaining it in-house, users can access these resources on-demand from remote servers located in datacenters. 
# Cloud Computing Models
1. Deployment model
  * Public
  * Private
  * Hybrid
2. Service Model
  * IaaS
  * PaaS
  * SaaS

# Cloud Deployment Models


## Public Cloud
- All internet users have access to the cloud
- Managed by CSP
- Example: Bus

## Private Cloud
- Only one organization has access to the cloud
- Managed by the organization itself or a third party
- Example: Car

## Hybrid Cloud
- A mix of both private and public cloud
- Acts as a public/ private cloud as required
- Example: Rent a car/ taxi
- Used by: Federal agencies

## Other cloud models
1. **Multi Cloud**: 

         One company uses TWO public clouds from TWO different CSPs for different purposes 

   * Using multiple cloud services from different cloud providers. 
   * Select the best cloud services for specific needs, rather than being locked into a single cloud provider. 
   * It provides redundancy and reduces the risk of vendor lock-in.
   * For example, an organization might use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their cloud storage needs and Microsoft Azure for their virtual machine needs.
 
   * Analogy: Think of multi-cloud as a supermarket where you can buy different types of products from different brands. Just as you can choose the best products from different brands in a supermarket, multi-cloud allows organizations to choose the best cloud services from different cloud providers for their specific needs.

2. **Hybrid Multi Cloud**:

         One company uses ONE private cloud and ONE public cloud from TWO different CSPs 

   * Combines both public and private cloud environments from multiple cloud providers. 
   * For example, an organization might use a public cloud provider like AWS for their web application hosting needs, while also using a private cloud environment for their sensitive data storage needs.
   * Analogy: Think of hybrid multi-cloud as a house that has both a public and a private area. Just as a house has a public area for guests and a private area for family members, hybrid multi-cloud allows organizations to use a public cloud environment for their web applications and a private cloud environment for their sensitive data storage needs.
      
# Cloud Service Models

## IaaS
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, what you do with that hardware is up to you.
- Used by: IT Administrators


## PaaS
- Platform as a Service
- Used for deploying, testing, or managing applications
- Deploys the application without managing the architectur
- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet, just like in IaaS. In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools.
- Used by: Software developers


## SaaS
- Software as a Service
- Used for hosting/ managing software applications
- Used by: Customers
- Example: MS Office

## Usecases of Service Models
When to use What?
- IaaS: When your business needs a VM
- PaaS: If your company need a platform/ interface for building software products
- SaaS: If your business doesnt wants to maintain any IT equipment


## Lifecycle of a Cloud Computing Solution
1. Define purpose: understand requirements
2. Define hardware: tools like EC2 and Lamda
3. Define storage: storage service to backup your data with tools S3, Glacier
4. Define network: for data transfer
5. Define security: tools as IAM, KMS, Cognito
6. Define management tools and processes: monitor resources 
7. Testing the process
8. Analytics: analyse and visualize data 

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  * **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision computing resources such as CPU, memory, and storage automatically and as needed without requiring human interaction.
  * **Broad network access:** Cloud services can be accessed over the internet from a range of devices such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktops.
  * **Resource pooling:** Cloud providers use a shared pool of resources to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to customer demand.
  * **Rapid elasticity:** Cloud providers can quickly allocate and de-allocate resources based on customer demand, providing scalability and agility to businesses.
  * **Measured service:** Cloud providers offer services that are metered and billed based on usage, allowing users to pay only for what they use.

## Key Drivers for Cloud Migration
- Cost Savings: Reduced capital expenditures, pay-as-you-go pricing
- Scalability: Ability to easily scale resources up or down
- Agility: Quick deployment of new applications, services, and infrastructure
- Accessibility: Remote access to data and applications
- Security: Robust security measures and advanced tools
- Data management: Flexible, cost-efficient storage and management of large amounts of data

# How does DevOps work on the Cloud
DevOps and cloud computing go hand in hand. DevOps on the cloud utilizes cloud computing infrastructure to help teams collaborate and streamline the software development process. The cloud allows development teams to access shared resources like storage, servers, and databases, all of which can be managed using DevOps tools. Developers can continuously test applications on virtual machines, and deploy changes in the cloud without disrupting the production environment. 

Additionally, DevOps on the cloud enables developers to take advantage of cloud-native tools such as containerization, which helps to ensure application portability and consistency across environments. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure offer a variety of DevOps tools that significantly simplify and automate DevOps processes. By deploying DevOps in the cloud, development teams are better placed to deliver software more efficiently and at a faster rate.
