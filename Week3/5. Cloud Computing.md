# Cloud Computing

# Cloud Computing Models
1. Deployment model
  * Public
  * Private
  * Hybrid
3. Service Model
  * IaaS
  * PaaS
  * SaaS

# Cloud Deployment Models

## Private Cloud
## Public Cloud
## Hybrid Cloud

# Cloud Service Models

## IaaS
- In IaaS, youâ€™re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

## PaaS
- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet, just like in IaaS. In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools.


## SaaS

## Lifecycle of a Cloud Computing Solution

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  * **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision computing resources such as CPU, memory, and storage automatically and as needed without requiring human interaction.
  * **Broad network access:** Cloud services can be accessed over the internet from a range of devices such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktops.
  * **Resource pooling:** Cloud providers use a shared pool of resources to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to customer demand.
  * **Rapid elasticity:** Cloud providers can quickly allocate and de-allocate resources based on customer demand, providing scalability and agility to businesses.
  * **Measured service:** Cloud providers offer services that are metered and billed based on usage, allowing users to pay only for what they use.
