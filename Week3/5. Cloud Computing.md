# Cloud Computing vs On Premise

Cloud Computing   | On Premise
--- | --- 
**SCALABILITY**               | 
Pay only for how much you use |Pay more, high maintenance cost
Easily scale up/ down         |Can not scale down
**STORAGE**                |
Cloud service providers manage servers | Takes a lot of space and money
**SECURITY**|
Better secuirty | less secure
Security protcols are managed by CSP|
**DATA LOSS**|
Robust disaster recovery measures|Little chances of retrieval
Faster and easier data recovery|
**COLLABORATION**|
High|Low


# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, including software, network infrastructure, and data storage, over the internet. Instead of investing in physical infrastructure and maintaining it in-house, users can access these resources on-demand from remote servers located in datacenters. 
# Cloud Computing Models
1. Deployment model
  * Public
  * Private
  * Hybrid
2. Service Model
  * IaaS
  * PaaS
  * SaaS

# Cloud Deployment Models


## Public Cloud
- All internet users have access to the cloud
- Managed by CSP
- Example: Bus

## Private Cloud
- Only one organization has access to the cloud
- Managed by the organization itself or a third party
- Example: Car

## Hybrid Cloud
- A mix of both private and public cloud
- Acts as a public/ private cloud as required
- Example: Rent a car/ taxi
- Used by: Federal agencies

# Cloud Service Models

## IaaS
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, what you do with that hardware is up to you.
- Used by: IT Administrators


## PaaS
- Platform as a Service
- Used for deploying, testing, or managing applications
- Deploys the application without managing the architectur
- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet, just like in IaaS. In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools.
- Used by: Software developers


## SaaS
- Software as a Service
- Used for hosting/ managing software applications
- Used by: Customers
- Example: MS Office

## Simple Example differentiating the three service Models

## Usecases of Service Models
When to use What?
- IaaS: When your business needs a VM
- PaaS: If your company need a platform/ interface for building software products
- SaaS: If your business doesnt wants to maintain any IT equipment


## Lifecycle of a Cloud Computing Solution
1. Define purpose: understand requirements
2. Define hardware: tools like EC2 and Lamda
3. Define storage: storage service to backup your data with tools S3, Glacier
4. Define network: for data transfer
5. Define security: tools as IAM, KMS, Cognito
6. Define management tools and processes: monitor resources 
7. Testing the process
8. Analytics: analyse and visualize data 

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  * **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision computing resources such as CPU, memory, and storage automatically and as needed without requiring human interaction.
  * **Broad network access:** Cloud services can be accessed over the internet from a range of devices such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, and desktops.
  * **Resource pooling:** Cloud providers use a shared pool of resources to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to customer demand.
  * **Rapid elasticity:** Cloud providers can quickly allocate and de-allocate resources based on customer demand, providing scalability and agility to businesses.
  * **Measured service:** Cloud providers offer services that are metered and billed based on usage, allowing users to pay only for what they use.
