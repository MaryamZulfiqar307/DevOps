# Organizational Impact of DevOps
- Organizational culture: Agile
- Small, dedicated teams
- Cross functional teams (no silos)
- Self organizing teams (sprints)

## Conway's Law
   Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

### Example
If you have three teams for user interface, database and applicaition you get a 3 tier architecture.

## DevOps Teams
A good practice is to reorganize teams around the architecture you want them to build. 
- Teams are crossfunctional and self organizing
- Align teams with their business domain
- Teams should have a long term mission
- They own what they build
