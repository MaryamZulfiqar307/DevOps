# Site Reliability Engineering
- SREs focus on automating their job 
- Anything you do repeatedly should be automated
- SRE works more on the operation side of the software
- SREs are not programmers
- Focus: Create highly reliable and scalable software systems

## Tenets of SRE
- Hire only software engineers
- Engineers work on reducing toil through automation
- SRE Teams are seperate from Development teams

## Error Budget
- Controls stability
- It manages the acceptable level of errors or downtime in a system or service
- If error budget exceeds, software deployment is restricted

#### Example
For example, let's say a software engineering team is building a new web application. The team might set an error budget that allows for up to 0.1% of user transactions to fail or for responses to take up to 2 seconds to load. This means that if the application exceeds these error thresholds, the team will need to take action to fix the issue before more errors occur.

## Differences in SRE and DevOps
- SRE has different Dev and Ops teams whereas DevOps breaks silos into one team with one objective.
- SRE uses error budget to maintain stability whereas DevOps uses CI/CD piplines
- SRE maintains the Infrastructure and DevOps uses the Infrastructure
- For example: The cloud can be SRE and the application can be DevOps

## Commonality in SRE and DevOps
- Dev and Ops work visible to eachother
- BLameless culture
- Objective: Deploy software faster with stability
