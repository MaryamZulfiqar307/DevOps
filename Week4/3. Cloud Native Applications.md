Previously in Week 2 we have studied Cloud Native Microservices and Architecture. Lets take a look at Cloud Native applications.
# Legacy Applications
- Not designed specifically for the cloud environment
- Built as a single, large codebase
- Deployed on physical servers or virtual machines
- Managed using traditional IT operations practices
- Difficult to scale and update
- May require significant downtime for maintenance and upgrades

# Cloud Native Applications
- Designed specifically for the cloud environment
- Built using cloud technologies like containers, microservices, and serverless functions
- Scalable and flexible to handle unpredictable workloads
- Resilient and fault-tolerant to handle component or service failures
- Developed using a DevOps approach for collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery
- Platform independent and can run on any cloud environment without modification.

## Example of Legacy Application Migration: Instagram

In its early days, Instagram used a monolithic architecture, where the entire application was built as a single codebase and deployed on physical servers or virtual machines. However, as the platform grew and needed to handle more traffic and users, Instagram migrated to a microservices architecture.

Today, Instagram's application is built using a combination of different microservices that communicate with each other through APIs. These microservices handle specific functions of the platform, such as user authentication, photo uploading, and news feed generation.

The application is deployed on a cloud infrastructure like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and uses containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. This allows Instagram to scale its application quickly and efficiently as it grows, while also being able to update and deploy new features and services without causing downtime or disruption to the user experience.


## Key Characteristics of Cloud-Native Applications
1. **Microservices**
    - Application structured as a collection of small, independent services
    - Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently

2. **Containers**
    - Portable, lightweight container that can run consistently across different cloud environments
    - Allows developers to package application and dependencies

3. **Scalability**
      - Designed to handle unpredictable workloads 
      - Responds to changing demand quickly and efficiently
      - Achieved through the use of cloud-native technologies such as auto-scaling, load balancing, and elastic infrastructure

4. **Resilience**
    - Can continue to function even if a component or service fails
    - Achieved through the use of cloud-native technologies such as fault-tolerance, self-healing, and disaster recovery

5. **DevOps**
    - Emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery
    - Streamlines the development, testing, and deployment of cloud-native applications
    - Allows for faster time-to-market and improved quality

6. **Platform Independence**
    - Designed to run on any cloud environment without modification
    - Achieved through the use of cloud-native technologies such as containerization and standard APIs

## Examples of Cloud-Native Applications

- Netflix
- Airbnb
- Uber
- Dropbox and Google Drive
- Facebook and Instagram
- Amazon and Alibaba
- PayPal etc.

All these applications have the following in common:
   
   1. Built on a cloud-native architecture
   2. Netflix and Uber use microservices architecture and container technology
   3. Handles large-scale, unpredictable workloads with ease
   4. Responds to changing demand quickly and efficiently
   5. Uses a DevOps approach for continuous deployment of new features and updates
   6. Airbnb and Uber use machine learning and data analytics to personalize the user experience or optimize pricing/ route planning algorithms respectively.
