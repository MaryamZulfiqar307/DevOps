# DevOps vs DevSecOps 

Category	|DevOps|	DevSecOps
--- |---|---
Focus|	Streamlining software development and operations	|Integrating security into the development process
Culture	|Collaboration and open communication	|Security-first mindset and culture of collaboration
Automation	|Relies heavily on automation to improve efficiency|	Includes security testing and analysis in automation
Testing|	Focuses on functional testing	|Includes security testing and analysis in testing
Deployment	|Focuses on continuous delivery and deployment|	Includes security in the deployment process
Responsibility|	Development and operations teams	|All members of the development team, including security
Security|	Not the primary focus, but is important	|Primary focus from the beginning of the development cycle


In summary, while DevOps and DevSecOps share some similarities in terms of collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery, the key difference is that DevSecOps incorporates security into every stage of the software development lifecycle, whereas DevOps focuses more on streamlining the development and operations process. Additionally, DevSecOps requires a culture of collaboration and a security-first mindset throughout the organization.

# Example of DevSecOps
Lets discuss DevSecOps Practices in the Development of Adidas' CONFIRMED App
### Overview:
   - Adidas CONFIRMED app is a mobile application that allows customers to purchase limited edition sneakers directly from Adidas.
   - The app is designed to handle a high volume of traffic during product launches and needs to be secure.
### DevSecOps practices:

   - Automated security testing and code analysis tools are integrated into the development pipeline to identify potential security issues early in the process.
   - Dedicated security team works closely with the development team to address any security issues that arise.
   - Continuous monitoring and logging of the app's infrastructure to identify and respond to any security incidents quickly.
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure that the app remains secure over time.

### Benefits:

   - The implementation of DevSecOps practices has helped Adidas create a secure, reliable application that can handle high traffic volumes.
   - Customers can enjoy a positive experience while purchasing limited edition sneakers directly from Adidas.
