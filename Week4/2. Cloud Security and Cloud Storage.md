# Cloud security 
Cloud security refers to the set of practices, technologies, and policies used to protect cloud-based assets, applications, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. 

## Security threats
- **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as financial information, customer records, or intellectual property.

- **Malware attacks:** Malicious software that infects cloud infrastructure, applications, or data, potentially causing data loss, theft, or destruction.

- **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Attempts to overload cloud infrastructure with traffic, rendering it unavailable to users.

- **Insider threats:** Employees, contractors, or other insiders who intentionally or unintentionally expose sensitive data or damage cloud infrastructure.

## Security measures

- **Encryption:** The use of encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or interception.

- **Access controls:** Policies and technologies used to limit access to cloud resources, applications, and data to authorized users only.
- **Firewalls:** Software or hardware-based security systems used to monitor and control network traffic entering and leaving cloud infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability scanning:** Regular assessments of cloud infrastructure and applications to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Security information and event management (SIEM):** Tools used to monitor and analyze security events and alerts in real-time, enabling rapid response to potential security incidents.

# Cloud Storage

## Object storage
- Each piece of data is stored as an object
- Data is stored in a a single "bucket- A flat address space" instead of files in a folder.
- Each object has a unique key for easy retrieval of data
- Stores large volumes of unstructured data (documents, images, videos, and audio files)
- Highly scalable and can store vast amounts of data. 
- Durable and reliable, with built-in redundancy and data protection features. 
- Can be accessed through a web-based API, which makes it easy to integrate with cloud-based applications and services.
- Examples: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.

### Analogy
Think of object storage as a garage where you can store different types of items in different bins.

## File storage
- Stores files and directories in a shared environment. 
- Hierarchical folder and file format. 
- A centralized location for storing and sharing files
- AKA network-attached storage (NAS) server with common file level protocols of Server Message Block (SMB) used in Windows instances and Network File System (NFS) found in Linux.
- Examples: Amazon EFS, Google Cloud Filestore, and Microsoft Azure Files.

### Analogy
Think of file storage as a bookshelf where you can store books and access them as needed. 

## Block storage
- Stores structured data, such as databases and applications. 
- Divides data into fixed-sized blocks and stores them in a specific order.
- Block storage volumes can be attached to cloud-based VMs to provide persistent storage. This means that the data stored on a block storage volume will persist even if the virtual machine is terminated.
- provides high-performance storage for applications that require low-latency access to data.
- Same as direct-attached storage (DAS) or storage area network (SAN). 
- Each block has its own unique identifier for quick storage and retrieval.
- Examples: Amazon EBS, Google Cloud Persistent Disk, and Microsoft Azure Managed Disks.

### Analogy
Think of block storage as a closet with different shelves that you can access separately.
