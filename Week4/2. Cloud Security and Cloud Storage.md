# Cloud security 
Cloud security refers to the set of practices, technologies, and policies used to protect cloud-based assets, applications, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. 

## Security threats
- **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as financial information, customer records, or intellectual property.

- **Malware attacks:** Malicious software that infects cloud infrastructure, applications, or data, potentially causing data loss, theft, or destruction.

- **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Attempts to overload cloud infrastructure with traffic, rendering it unavailable to users.

- **Insider threats:** Employees, contractors, or other insiders who intentionally or unintentionally expose sensitive data or damage cloud infrastructure.

## Security measures

- **Encryption:** The use of encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or interception.

- **Access controls:** Policies and technologies used to limit access to cloud resources, applications, and data to authorized users only.
- **Firewalls:** Software or hardware-based security systems used to monitor and control network traffic entering and leaving cloud infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability scanning:** Regular assessments of cloud infrastructure and applications to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Security information and event management (SIEM):** Tools used to monitor and analyze security events and alerts in real-time, enabling rapid response to potential security incidents.

# Cloud Storage

## Object storage
- Object storage is a type of storage that stores data in a flat address space known as a "bucket." Here data is stored in a single bucket instead of files in a folder.
- Each piece of data is stored as an object
- Objects are stored with a unique identifier, or key, that makes it easy to retrieve them later. 
- Object storage systems are designed to store large volumes of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and audio files.
- Object storage is highly scalable and can store vast amounts of data. It is also durable and reliable, with built-in redundancy and data protection features. 
- It can be accessed through a web-based API, which makes it easy to integrate with cloud-based applications and services.
- Examples: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.

### Analogy
Think of object storage as a garage where you can store different types of items in different bins. Just as you can store different types of items in different bins in a garage, object storage allows you to store different types of data in different "buckets" in the cloud, and access them as needed.

## File storage
- File storage is optimized for storing files and directories in a shared environment. 
- It stores data in a hierarchical folder and file format. 
- File storage systems provide a centralized location for storing and sharing files, and are typically used for applications that require shared access to files, such as media sharing or collaborative document editing.
- Its also known as a network-attached storage (NAS) server with common file level protocols of Server Message Block (SMB) used in Windows instances and Network File System (NFS) found in Linux.
- Examples: Amazon EFS, Google Cloud Filestore, and Microsoft Azure Files.

### Analogy
Think of file storage as a bookshelf where you can store books and access them as needed. Just as you can store books on a bookshelf and access them as needed, file storage allows you to store and manage files in the cloud, making it easier to access and share files from different devices and locations.

## Block storage
- Block storage is a type of storage that is optimized for storing structured data, such as databases and applications. 
- It is called "block" storage because it divides data into fixed-sized blocks and stores them in a specific order.
- Block storage volumes can be attached to cloud-based virtual machines to provide persistent storage. This means that the data stored on a block storage volume will persist even if the virtual machine is terminated. 
- Block storage is typically used to provide high-performance storage for applications that require low-latency access to data.
- This is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a storage area network (SAN). 
- Each block has its own unique identifier for quick storage and retrieval.
- Examples: Amazon EBS, Google Cloud Persistent Disk, and Microsoft Azure Managed Disks.

### Analogy
Think of block storage as a closet with different shelves that you can access separately. Just as you can access different shelves separately in a closet, block storage allows you to access different parts of a large storage space separately, allowing for more flexibility in managing data.
