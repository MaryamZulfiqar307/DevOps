# Cloud Infrastructure
- Underlying hardware and software components that enable cloud computing services to operate
- Components are servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and software applications(DB, OS, VMs) 

## Cloud Infrastructure vs Cloud Architecture
- Cloud infrastructure refers to the underlying physical and virtual resources, such as servers, storage, and networking components, that enable cloud computing services to operate. It is the *hardware and software* foundation upon which cloud services are built.

- Cloud architecture, on the other hand, refers to the *design and organization* of cloud computing services and resources. It is the high-level plan that outlines how cloud services will be structured, how they will interact with each other, and how they will be used to meet the needs of the organization.

Level of detail|lower-level details of cloud computing, such as server configurations and network topology|higher-level design and planning of cloud services
Examples|Amazon Web Services (AWS), would be responsible for providing the cloud infrastructure necessary to run its cloud services.| The cloud architecture of AWS would describe how its various services are organized and how they can be used to meet different business needs.

## Components of Cloud Infrastructure
- **Physical hardware:** 
   - physical servers, storage devices, and networking components that make up the physical infrastructure of the cloud
   - These components are housed in data centers and are managed by cloud service providers.

- **Virtualization software:** 
   - Allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, making more efficient use of hardware resources. 
   - Allows cloud providers to offer flexible and scalable services to their customers.

- **Operating systems:** 
   - Operating systems, such as Linux or Windows, are installed on the physical servers and virtual machines. 
   - Responsible for managing resources, scheduling tasks, and providing a platform for applications to run on.

- **Storage systems:** 
   - provide customers with the ability to store and retrieve data. 
   - Can be either block storage (SAN or NAS) or object storage (Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage)

- **Networking components:** 
   - Networking components, such as routers, switches, and load balancers, are used to connect the different components of the cloud infrastructure together
   - These components provide the network connectivity necessary for cloud services to operate

- **Management and monitoring tools:** 
   - Used to manage the various components of the cloud and ensure that they are operating efficiently
   - provide administrators with visibility into the performance and availability of the cloud services

In summary, cloud infrastructure consists of physical hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, storage systems, networking components, and management and monitoring tools. These components work together to provide cloud service providers with the ability to deliver flexible, scalable, and reliable cloud computing services to their customers.

# Virtualization
Creating a virtual layer over the hardware using a software(hypervisor) is called virtualization


## Virtual Machines (Guest and Host Machine)
The guest machine that has been virtually generated using the hypervisor is called the virtual machine. It has its own OS and will operate seperately from the hardware machine (the host machine). 

### Example 
- Host Machine: Windows OS on a PC
- Guest Machine: Linux/ Mac OS virtually created on Windows

 ### Hypervisor: 
A hypervisor is software that creates and manages VMs on a physical server. It allows multiple VMs to share the same physical resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, while providing each VM with the illusion of being the only one running on the server.

### Example
VMware, Hyper-V

### Types of Hypervisor:
- **Type 1 Hypervisor:** 
   - Also known as Bare metal.
   - Its not installed on the operating system
   - This is the Native hypervisor
   - It directly interacts with hardware and user resources

- **Type 2 Hypervisor:** 
   - Also known as embedded/ host hypervisor.
   - Its installed on the operating system
   - It runs as an application on the host operating system

## Benefits of Virtualization
- Better resource utilization
- Remote access
- Lowers the cost of IT infrastructure
- VMs are independant of each other
- Enables running multiple OS in one hardware

## Relation to cloud
Virtualization is a key component of cloud computing and is used to create virtual machines (VMs) that can be used to deliver cloud services. Cloud providers set up and maintain their own data centers. They create different virtual environments that use the underlying hardware resources. 

Cloud providers use virtualization to create virtual servers, virtual storage, and virtual networks, which they can then provide to customers as services. These virtual resources can be provisioned and managed by customers through a web-based interface or an API, and can be scaled up or down as needed.

Virtualization in the cloud also provides a high degree of flexibility and agility. Because virtual resources are independent of physical hardware, they can be easily moved between physical machines, allowing for workload balancing and maintenance without downtime.

Overall, virtualization in the cloud enables efficient use of resources, reduces costs, provides flexibility and agility, and enables on-demand provisioning of services.
