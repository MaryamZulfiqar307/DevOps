# Cloud monitoring 
- A process of managing and analyzing the performance of a cloud-based IT infrastructure.
- Involves reviewing and observing websites, servers, applications, databases, and other cloud resources to ensure they are available and functioning properly.
- Helps to identify and predict possible issues before they become major problems, minimizing downtime and improving performance.
- Performed manually or through automated management techniques.

## Types of cloud monitoring

## Database monitoring
   - Reviews processes, queries, availability, and consumption of cloud database resources
   - Tracks queries and data integrity
   - Monitors connections to show real-time usage data
   - Tracks access requests for security purposes
   - Alerts for database instability to improve resolution response time

## Website monitoring
   - Tracks processes, traffic, availability, and resource utilization of cloud-hosted sites
   - Monitors website performance and availability
   
## Virtual network monitoring
   - Creates software versions of network technology (e.g., firewalls, routers, and load balancers)
   - Provides data about their operation
   - Adjusts to optimize the flow of data, instead of swapping hardware
   
## Cloud storage monitoring
   - Tracks multiple analytics simultaneously
   - Monitors storage resources and processes provisioned to virtual machines, services, databases, and applications
   - Tracks performance metrics, processes, users, databases, and available storage
   - Helps focus on useful features and fix bugs that disrupt functionality
   
## Virtual machine monitoring
   - Simulates a computer within a computer
   - Tracks users, traffic, and status of each machine
   - Scaled out in IaaS as a virtual server that hosts several virtual desktops
   - Provides benefits of traditional IT infrastructure monitoring with the added benefit of cloud monitoring solutions
  
## Benefits of cloud monitoring
- Minimizes downtime
- Improves performance
- Enhances security
- Increases efficiency
- Enables proactive maintenance
- Improves customer satisfaction
